Urgent Request:  Tina Shepard cannot remove her key from her office door handle.  The core comes out of the unit.  Her office cannot be secured.  Can you please assist in this request ASAP?    Thank you!  Julie Rice  602-496-8038  42B1OOD. Leak reported, Blower requested for Row F in Library.. My office is always warm. I have to keep a fan on me all the time and the door open in order to bring cooler air into my office...the weekends are extra bad.... !! The air-conditioning in A102 and A114 is not working right - It has heated up to 80 degrees and is blowing warm air.   4N0J2L9. !! Repeat Request. Please turn on the air conditioning for office 580 G on the weekends.  I work both days on the weekends and the heat is unbearable.   Thank you.   42BJJJ7. Yikes! Our brand new air-conditioning in the front office is blowing warm air...  4N0J2L9. Temperature in Merc E101 Office is rising and becoming uncomfortable... do you have a timeframe for the contractor visit? I\\'ll go take a fan down to her office and see if that helps.  Thanks.  42DINGO. Duct detector is in a supervisory condition. Please check per security.. Remove, clean and replace filters for Modine units.. Check all units on roofs for filter sizing information and create a spreadsheet with unit ID information to utilize with project stakeholders.  Arrange filter change for new units as they have a temp filter in place.. Main air duct is separated from HVAC unit 3-14. Please scheduled warranty repair with EMCOR as the unit is a recently installed unit.. !! Participants & Presenters are too warm in the classrooms for this all-week meeting.  The Copper Room B4-102 is set at 78 degrees and should be set at 74 per our conversations & the temp is about 76 in there.  Silver and Turquoise thermostats are reading about 75 or 76.  They are fanning themselve. . .. !! AC Unit is leaking condensation onto the ceiling tiles in our area.  42DIFNG. '"
